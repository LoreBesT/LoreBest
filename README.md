  ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and thanks for visiting my profile
I'm Lorenzo, if you want to contact me send a mail to lorenzodellabona06@gmail.com. I know C, Python and Dart(with Flutter framework).In the future I would also like to learn C++ and assembly at an advanced level. Actually I'm working on a flutter app that includes Gemini API and Firebase.
